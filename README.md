## This app uses: 
- Free API from [https://8ball.delegator.com](https://8ball.delegator.com) to get random predications each time when user shake a device. 
- Checking network connection every time to use API, if the app can't access the network it'll use hardcoded predication and user's own predications.
- Core Data to persist user's own predications between launches.
